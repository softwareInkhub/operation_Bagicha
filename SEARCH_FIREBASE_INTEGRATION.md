# Search Firebase Integration

This document explains the Firebase integration for search functionality in the Bagicha app.

## Overview

The search functionality has been updated to fetch data from Firebase instead of using hardcoded data. This includes:

1. **SearchModal** - Now fetches search results, recent searches, and trending searches from Firebase
2. **SearchBar** - Now fetches search suggestions from Firebase
3. **FeaturedProducts** - Now fetches plant products from Firebase instead of showing grocery items

## Firebase Collections

### 1. searchSuggestions
Stores search suggestions that appear in the search bar and modal.

**Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  term: string          // The search term
  type: 'product' | 'category'
  category: string      // Optional category
}
```

### 2. recentSearches
Stores user's recent search history.

**Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  term: string          // The search term
  timestamp: Date       // When the search was performed
}
```

### 3. trendingSearches
Stores trending search terms with popularity metrics.

**Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  term: string          // The search term
  count: number         // Search count/popularity
  trend: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable'  // Trend direction
}
```
